## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip or conda package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd NLP_Evolution_claude
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Download NLTK data (first run only):**
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

4. **Optional: Download GloVe embeddings for Chapter 2.9:**
   - Download `glove.6B.zip` from [Stanford NLP](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)
   - Extract and place `glove.6B.50d.txt` in the project directory
   - Rename it to `glove.6B.50dsmall.txt`

### Running the Application

**Option 1: Quick Launch (Recommended)**
```bash
python launch_app.py
```
This will automatically find an available port and open your browser.

**Option 2: Standard Streamlit**
```bash
streamlit run nlp_evolution_app.py
```

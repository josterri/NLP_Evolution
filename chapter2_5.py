    Word embeddings were a massive breakthrough, but they still have a crucial flaw: **they are static**. This means that each word has only *one* vector representation, regardless of how it's used in a sentence.

    This becomes a major issue for words with multiple meanings, a phenomenon known as **polysemy**.

    Consider the word "**bank**":
    - "I need to go to the **bank** to deposit money." (a financial institution)
    - "We sat on the river **bank** and watched the boats." (the side of a river)

    A static embedding model like Word2Vec is forced to learn a single vector for "bank". This vector ends up being a confusing, watered-down average of its different meanings. It's not quite a financial vector, and not quite a geographical one. This ambiguity limits the model's ability to truly understand the nuance of a sentence.

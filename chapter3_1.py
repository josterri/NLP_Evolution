    As we saw, static embeddings (like Word2Vec) were a massive leap forward. They gave models a sense of a word's general meaning. However, they suffer from a fundamental flaw: **they assign only one vector to each word**.

    Language is ambiguous. The same word can have completely different meanings depending on the context. This is the **problem of polysemy**.

    Consider the word "**bank**":
    - "I need to go to the **bank** to deposit money." (a financial institution)
    - "We sat on the river **bank** and watched the boats." (the side of a river)

    A static embedding for "bank" is an awkward average of these two meanings. To truly understand language, a model needs to generate **dynamic, contextual embeddings**‚Äîvectors that change based on the surrounding words.

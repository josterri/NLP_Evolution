    In the last chapter, we saw the power of word embeddings. They act like a sophisticated dictionary, where each word has a single, fixed entry (its vector). But what happens when a word has multiple definitions?

    This is the **problem of polysemy**, and it's the critical limitation of static embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe.

    Consider the word "**bat**":
    - "He swung the **bat** and hit a home run." (a piece of sports equipment)
    - "A **bat** flew out of the cave at dusk." (a nocturnal flying mammal)

    A static embedding model is forced to learn a single vector for "bat". This vector ends up being a confusing average of its different meanings. It's not quite a sports vector, and not quite an animal vector. This ambiguity limits the model's ability to truly understand the nuance of a sentence.

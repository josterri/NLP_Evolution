    3.  **Fine-tune on a Specific Task:** We then train this combined model on our specific, smaller dataset (e.g., 10,000 movie reviews). The training process slightly adjusts the weights of the entire model, but mostly trains the new classification head to map the Transformer's sophisticated output to our desired labels (e.g., 'Positive' or 'Negative').

    This approach is incredibly powerful and efficient because we are leveraging the billions of parameters and the vast knowledge already encoded in the pre-trained model.
